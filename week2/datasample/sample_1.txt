Ohhhh, a pirate's life
Is the life for me
I love to sail
The deep blue sea
The whole Spanish main
Won't ever be the same
I'll be the best
Of the pirate kings!

Ohhhh, a jolly roger
Is what I need
My crew will follow
Where I lead
We are rough, we are tough
And we really know our stuff
A pirate's life
Is the life for me

Ohhhh, the plank is walked
Most every day
A pirate needs
His time to play
We huff and we puff
Won't ever have enough
A pirate's life
Is the life for me

We're searchin' for
A treasure chest
The gold and silver
We like best
Doubloons everywhere
There's danger in the air
A pirate's life
Is the life for me

Ohhhh, a pirate's life
Is the life for me
I love to sail
The deep blue sea
The whole Spanish main
Won't ever be the same
A pirate's life
Is the life for me
The whole Spanish main
Won't ever be the same
A pirate's life
Is the life for me
